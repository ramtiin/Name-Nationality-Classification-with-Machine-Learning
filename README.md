# Name-Nationality-Classification-with-Machine-Learning
In this notebook, I tried to predict nationalities based on people's names using MultinomialNB. The dataset is downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wRQfw5EYpzulvRfHCGIUWB2am5JUYVGk/view?usp=sharing). Since the dataset was too large and was hard to use with pandas and sklearnscikit-learn, I made a miniature version of it with 17 countries and 100,000 records for each one.
I found the original dataset along with people's gender and country from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/philipperemy/name-dataset).
